Step-by-Step Guide: Safe Inspection of Arduino Setup on Production PC

Purpose: Ensure you can verify the current Arduino IDE setup, installed cores, and board information before making any changes. This guide is read-only and will not modify your current setup.

---

## 1. Inspect Installed Cores via Arduino IDE

1. Open the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Go to **Tools → Board → Boards Manager**.
3. In the Boards Manager window, scroll or search for **Arduino AVR Boards**.

   * Note the **version number** listed. This is the installed core for AVR boards (e.g., Uno, Mega).
4. Optionally, check for any other installed cores your production environment uses.

## 2. Identify the Current Board in Use

1. In Arduino IDE, go to **Tools → Board → Board**.

   * Note the exact board selected (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega 2560).
   * This tells you the **Fully Qualified Board Name (FQBN)** for CLI usage.
2. Go to **Tools → Port** and note the COM port assigned to the board.

## 3. Verify Core Installation via Arduino CLI (Optional, Read-Only)

*Note: Only do this if `arduino-cli` is installed. Running these commands will not change anything.*

1. Open a **PowerShell** window.
2. List installed cores:

```powershell
arduino-cli core list
```

Example output:

```
arduino:avr 1.8.6 installed
arduino:samd 1.8.13 installed
```

* `installed` means the core is present.
* No changes are made to your system.

## 4. Confirm Board Detection via CLI (Optional)

```powershell
arduino-cli board list
```

* Lists connected boards and the assigned port.
* Matches what the IDE shows under **Tools → Port**.

## 5. Notes on Safe CLI Commands

| Command                           | Effect                                   | Safety                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `arduino-cli core update-index`   | Refreshes metadata about available cores | ✅ Safe, read-only, does not touch existing cores |
| `arduino-cli core install <core>` | Installs or updates a core               | ⚠️ Will modify your system                       |
| `arduino-cli core upgrade <core>` | Upgrades an existing core                | ⚠️ Will modify your system                       |

### Recommendation:

* On a production PC, **run only inspection commands** (`core list` and `board list`) to document the setup.
* Avoid running install or upgrade commands unless you are ready to make changes.

## 6. Document Your Findings

Create a record for recovery purposes:

* Arduino IDE version
* Installed cores and versions
* Selected board and port
* Any other libraries in use

Keep this document safe. If changes are made later, you can restore the exact setup.
